## 👋 Hi, I’m Niña Peterine Sheen Suico (Reina)

Business Systems . Operations Automation . Data Analytics  

I build AI-enabled workflows, automation systems, and data pipelines that translate messy real-world operations into structured, operable systems.
My work spans system architecture, orchestration logic, and analytics, with attention to tradeoffs, reliability, and scaling constraints.

I currently work as a Strategic Partnerships and Special Operations Lead, designing sales and operational architectures that scale across teams.

My background spans client services, BPO operations, and process coordination.

### What I work on
- Workflow automation and orchestration (forms, approvals, reminders)
- Process documentation and system architecture
- Data modeling, reporting, and operational analytics
- Analytics systems using SQL and Power BI
